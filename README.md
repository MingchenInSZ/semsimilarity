# semsimilarity
This project help biologist to calcaulte  gene similarity and constructe the pathway network

First, in this project, it uses the Wang's semantic method to calculate the similarity of go term and use the BMA method
to calcualte the gene's.

  And the user can choose the directly method in sim.wang package, which may be slow; or choose the dump wang's meothd, which
has dumped all the go semantic values and loaded it on demand.

  In the near future, we will add dowloader which load all the data necessary automatically, and update the dumped sval 
timely. 

  Furthermore, we may provide a webserver to demonstrate and process the data provided in concern.
  
  
  Thanks for your attention!
